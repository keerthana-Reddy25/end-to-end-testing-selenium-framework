# end-to-end-testing-selenium-framework

In this comprehensive test automation project, I have crafted a robust framework to validate the functionality of an e-commerce website. The project is designed to execute end-to-end testing scenarios, covering aspects like order submission, error handling, and user validations. Leveraging a combination of Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Cucumber, this project embodies best practices in test automation.
Technologies Used:

1. Selenium WebDriver:
The core of the project is built upon Selenium WebDriver, a powerful tool for browser automation. Selenium enables the emulation of user interactions with the web application, ensuring that the end-to-end workflows are thoroughly tested. It offers a wide array of functionalities to manipulate and interact with web elements, providing a robust foundation for test scripts.

2. TestNG:
TestNG serves as the testing framework for organizing and executing test cases. Its annotation-based structure facilitates the creation of modular and maintainable test scripts. TestNG allows the categorization of tests into groups, providing flexibility in test suite execution. This ensures that specific sets of tests, such as purchase validations or error handling, can be run independently.

3. Cucumber:
Cucumber is employed to enhance the readability and collaboration of the test scenarios through behavior-driven development (BDD). The Gherkin syntax enables the representation of test scenarios in plain language, fostering collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders. Cucumber further enriches the project by serving as a bridge between the executable code and the human-readable feature files.

4. Maven:
Maven is utilized as the project management tool and a build automation tool. It simplifies the project setup, dependencies management, and the build process. Maven ensures consistency in project structure and enhances the maintainability of the project by managing external dependencies.

5. JSON for Data Storage:
The project utilizes JSON data for storing and managing test data. The DataReader class reads JSON files, providing a flexible and scalable approach for data-driven testing. JSON's hierarchical structure allows the storage of datasets in a readable and organized manner.

6. Page Object Model (POM):
The Page Object Model is employed to enhance the maintainability and reusability of the code. Page Objects encapsulate the functionalities of web pages, promoting a modular and scalable architecture. This design pattern isolates the web elements and their interactions, making the test scripts more robust to changes in the UI.

7. TestNG XML Configuration:
The TestNG XML configuration file defines the suite and test configurations. It facilitates the grouping of tests, parallel execution, and the inclusion/exclusion of specific test methods. This provides a high level of customization in test execution.

In conclusion, this test automation project showcases a comprehensive approach to testing an e-commerce website. By combining Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Cucumber, I've established a solid foundation for automated testing, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the tested application. The use of Maven, JSON, and POM further contributes to the scalability and maintainability of the project, making it a robust solution for continuous testing and integration.
